# Bliss Browser MFA Client

The Bliss Browser MFA client is a tool for authenticating sign-ins with MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

## Why not 2FA?

MFA also means 2FA (2 Factor Authentication) I prefer the term MFA, as it is expandable. When the need for 3FA (3 Factor Authentication) becomes a thing, MFA can then mean either 2FA or 3FA. THis will require 1 less acronym for each new iteration.

**TL;DR** MFA is the same thing as 2FA, it is just a different acronym.
